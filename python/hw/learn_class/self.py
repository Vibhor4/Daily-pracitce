"""
When an instance attribute is referenced that isnâ€™t a data attribute,
its class is searched. If the name denotes a valid class attribute
that is a function object, a method object is created
by packing (pointers to) the instance object and the function object
just found together in an abstract object:
this is the method object.
When the method object is called with an argument list,
a new argument list is constructed from the instance object
and the argument list, and the function object is called
with this new argument list.
